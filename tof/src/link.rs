//! Which bus the head ToF is on, and where on it.
//!
//! **The board decides the bus.** The Zero 3W robots carry the sensor on the HAT's I²C bus — a
//! VL53L5CX or a VL53L8CX, at one of two addresses. The beta board wires a VL53L8CX to SPI3, which
//! both its images expose as a spidev ([`BETA_SPI`]); the VL53L5CX has no SPI interface, so there
//! is nothing else that could be there. Trying both buses on every board would mean a beta probing
//! I²C addresses on the face board's bus for a sensor that is not on it, and a Zero 3W opening a
//! spidev it does not have — so the board, declared in `robotd.toml`, picks one, and the flags
//! below force either for bench work.
