//! `[board]` — which electronic board this robot is built on.
//!
//! **Declared, not detected.** Whatever sets a board up writes it — `provision-board.sh --board`,
//! or the image built for that board — and everything that differs between boards reads it from
//! here. Unset is `zero3`, which is every robot that existed before the key did.
//!
//! [`Board::detect`] reads the device tree, and only `robotctl health` uses it: to say when the
//! declaration and the hardware disagree. Nothing switches on what it finds, because a guess that
//! is right on the boards we have is not a fact about the next one.
//!
//! The board also decides which releases a robot can install, through the updater's `hw_rev`
//! (`docs/design/updater-design.md` §5.6).
