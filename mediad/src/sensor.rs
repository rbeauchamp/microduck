//! Which camera sensor this robot has, and the handful of facts about it that `mediad` cannot ask
//! the driver for.
//!
//! **The board decides which sensor is allowed; the media graph says which one is there.** A
//! camera and its board go together — the Zero 3W robots carry an IMX219, the beta board a GC2093
//! (`robotd_params::board::Board::camera_sensor`) — so the head camera must be the declared
//! board's, and a media graph holding another sensor is refused: that is a robot assembled with
//! the wrong module, or one declaring the wrong board, and both are worth stopping on rather than
//! streaming through. `[media] sensor` forces a named sensor instead, for a board fitted with
//! another camera on purpose. That is the exception, and it is logged as one.
//!
//! The sensor names itself in the topology (`m00_b_imx219 2-0010`, `m00_b_gc2093 2-0037`), which
//! is how the check is made — and why a sensor this daemon has no profile for is refused by name
//! rather than driven with another sensor's numbers. Exposure in the wrong units is a picture that
//! is black or white, and a field of view borrowed from another lens is a geometry that is quietly
//! wrong — and a consumer has no way to tell.
//!
//! Everything else about a sensor is either read from the driver at run time or is the same for
//! every sensor here — the pinned mode is 1920×1080 raw 10-bit on both. What is in a [`Sensor`] is
//! what is left: the units its controls are in, the exposure the auto-exposure loop may spend, and
//! the optics, when anyone has measured them.
