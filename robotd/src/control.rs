//! Turning sensors and a command into joint targets — and scheduling the skills.
//!
//! Everything here is pure computation between [`duck_control::io::RobotIo::read`] and the
//! safety layer's `apply`. It holds no IO handle — by construction it cannot command a
//! motor, only propose targets.
//!
//! The tick, in order:
//!
//! ```text
//! skill windows ← advance / expire (roulade window, kick timer, ground-pick phase, sit↔stand rise)
//! command      ← the caller's smoothed command, re-encoded for the active skill
//! net          ← roulade > kick > ground pick > sit/rise > stand-by-magnitude > walk
//! action       ← ONNX
//! targets      ← home pose + action_scale × action
//! filters      ← optional first-order low-pass on head and legs
//! ```
//!
//! The priority chain and every numeric default come from `microduck_runtime`'s
//! `control_step`, which this replaces. Two of its subtleties are worth naming because they
//! are easy to "fix" by accident:
//!
//!  - **A kick window runs at standing tuning.** The kick's observation carries an all-zero
//!    command, and in the prototype the standing transition fires on exactly that — so a
//!    kick runs at `standing_action_scale` and the softened standing gain. Kept, because
//!    the kicks were tuned against it.
//!  - **The sitstand *rise* also runs at the standing gain** (its command is all-zero),
//!    while the *sit* does not (its posture flag makes the twist magnitude 1). Same
//!    mechanism, same reason.
//!
//! One deliberate divergence: the prototype tracks the standing action scale by
//! saving/restoring `action_scale` on transitions, which can leave a stale value behind
//! after a sit→stand cycle until the next walk. Here scale and gain are recomputed from
//! the active state every tick — same values on every path that matters, no leftovers.
//!
//! A second: **one move at a time, and none from the seat** ([`Controller::move_blocked`]). The
//! prototype let a pick preempt a kick's tail and a chaining skill roll out of a kick or the seat;
//! here each is refused, and a seated robot accepts only standing up.
