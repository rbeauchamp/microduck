//! `padd` — a gamepad, as an intent client.
//!
//! It has no privileged access to the robot. It reads a pad, turns sticks and buttons into
//! intents, and sends them over `robotd`'s socket like any other client.
//!
//! That is the point of it being a separate process rather than a thread inside `robotd`.
//! The intent API is the path the app, the SDK and any remote client will use, and here it
//! gets exercised every day by whoever is working on the robot — so it cannot quietly rot
//! the way an API only the phone app uses inevitably would. The cost is a socket hop: tens
//! of microseconds against a 20 ms tick.
//!
//! ## The mapping
//!
//! Laid out so that each part of the pad has one job: the face buttons and bumpers run skills,
//! the D-pad picks what the sticks mean, and the two small buttons in the middle are holds —
//! nothing that cuts torque or powers the robot off fires on a brush of the thumb.
//!
//! The six one-shot buttons are `[pad]` in `robotd.toml`, so a robot that has learned a new skill
//! can put it on a button without a release. Only those six: `Start`, the D-pad and held `Select`
//! are not `robot.do` calls, and the button that powers a robot off is the one binding worth not
//! being able to lose to a config edit.
//!
//! This daemon still knows nothing about what a skill *is*. It reads which button went down,
//! looks up the name beside it, and sends that name; `robotd` decides whether the robot has such
//! a thing and answers with the list it does have when it does not.
//!
//! ```text
//! A (South)       sit ↔ stand
//! B (East)        ground pick
//! X / Y           nothing, until a skill is bound there
//! LB / RB         left / right kick
//! RT / LT         mouth (either trigger; the max wins) · RT quacks · LT rides the wheee
//! D-pad up        head mode — the sticks pose the head, the body holds still
//! D-pad right     head + move — left stick walks and turns, right stick looks around
//! D-pad left      move — the sticks walk, strafe and turn
//! D-pad down      body + head — left stick crouches and leans sideways, right stick looks around
//! Start           first press stands up, then toggles the policy
//! Start, 1.5 s    home pose, motors stiff, policy off — a seated robot stays seated
//! Select, 2–4 s   let go: sit, rest pose, then torque off and every servo rebooted
//! Select, 4 s     sit, rest pose, then power off
//! ```
//!
//! The D-pad *selects* a mode rather than toggling one, so a press always lands where its arrow
//! says whatever mode the robot was in. Head and body + head mode both zero the velocity while
//! active — a robot that keeps walking because you started posing its head is a bad surprise —
//! and leaving a mode puts back what it moved: the body snaps to nominal, the head re-centres.
//!
//! Smoothing lives in `robotd` (`[control] cmd_alpha` / `head_alpha`), not here: this
//! process sends raw targets, so every client gets the same feel.
//!
//! ## Roller mode
//!
//! At startup this asks `robot.mode`. On a roller robot the stick mapping becomes the
//! prototype's roller preset — asymmetric forward/brake (0.6 / 0.5), no strafe, ±0.3 rad/s
//! heading — and B triggers the crouch that lives in the ground-pick slot. The other
//! skills ride along on wheels, as the rebased roller line has them. Switching between walk and
//! roller is `robot.setMode`; it is no longer on the pad.
//!
//! ## On the robot, this runs itself
//!
//! `padd.service` starts at boot and stays up whether or not a pad is present, so driving takes one
//! step and it is a pairing step: `sudo robotctl pad pair`, with the pad in pairing mode. The
//! pad is bonded *and trusted*, so it reconnects by itself afterwards, and this process picks it up
//! within a tick.
//!
//! Waiting with no pad is deliberately cheap and deliberately silent — nothing is sent, and
//! `robotd`'s deadman holds the robot on its own. Inventing a zero command instead would mask a
//! disconnected pad as someone's decision to stop.
//!
//! Pairing is **not** done here: bonding a device needs root and BlueZ, and a `padd` holding
//! either would stop being the unprivileged client whose whole value is having no special
//! access. It lives in `configd`, next to wifi.
//!
//! ## It also hands out the pad's raw input
//!
//! One socket, read-only, for `pad.input` and nothing else — `src/tap.rs`, and it does not make this
//! a privileged process. It exists because `padd` is the reason a stalled radio is invisible: the
//! sticks are *polled*, so the last known value keeps being sent — at the full rate, since a stick
//! reading anything but centre is never held back — whether or not the pad is still talking, and
//! every surface downstream then shows a robot with a live driver. The event
//! stream one layer below has the evidence, so it is passed out unaltered rather than summarised.
//! `robotctl monitor` draws it; `docs/robot/pair-a-gamepad.md` says how to read it.
//!
//! For development against a board: `ssh -L /tmp/robotd.sock:/run/robotd.sock duck`, then
//! point `--socket` at the forwarded path. Pad on your laptop, robot on the bench, no code.
//! `systemctl stop padd` first, or two processes fight over the sticks. Run that way, `--tap-socket`
//! wants a path you can write — `/run/padd/` belongs to the unit — and on a Mac there is no tap at
//! all, since it reads evdev.
